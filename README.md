Repo for project I did a while ago to practice mapping in R.

Used Companies House data to find pubs as share of businesses across the UK and then plotted the data on a map.

Link to results found [here](http://www.kylebuttner.com/maps).

Can't find the original dataset I used but pretty sure it was [these five files](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/basic-company-data) as they were when I did the project (Feb 2015ish).
